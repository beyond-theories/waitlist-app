              I'm truly excited to welcome you to Kollabo, a space we're

              As we have stated on the website, for now, we're working behind
              the scenes to craft something specialâ€”a platform where creators,
              thinkers, and doers across disciplines can connect, build, and
              bring ideas to life from start to finish, all in one seamless app.

            <Text className="text-sm leading-6 mb-4">
              Whether you're looking to kick off your next big idea, join a team
              with purpose, or simply grow through doing, Kollabo is being built
              with you in mind.

            <Text className="text-sm leading-6 mb-4">
